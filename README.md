# Flutter

A modern Flutter-based mobile application utilizing the latest mobile development technologies and tools for building responsive cross-platform applications.

## Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK (^3.29.2)
- Dart SDK
- Android Studio / VS Code with Flutter extensions
- Android SDK / Xcode (for iOS development)

## Installation

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
flutter pub get
```

2. Run the application:

To run the app with environment variables defined in an env.json file, follow the steps mentioned below:
1. Through CLI
    ```bash
    flutter run --dart-define-from-file=env.json
    ```
2. For VSCode
    - Open .vscode/launch.json (create it if it doesn't exist).
    - Add or modify your launch configuration to include --dart-define-from-file:
    ```json
    {
        "version": "0.2.0",
        "configurations": [
            {
                "name": "Launch",
                "request": "launch",
                "type": "dart",
                "program": "lib/main.dart",
                "args": [
                    "--dart-define-from-file",
                    "env.json"
                ]
            }
        ]
    }
    ```
3. For IntelliJ / Android Studio
    - Go to Run > Edit Configurations.
    - Select your Flutter configuration or create a new one.
    - Add the following to the "Additional arguments" field:
    ```bash
    --dart-define-from-file=env.json
    ```

```

## Adding Routes

To add new routes to the application, update the `lib/routes/app_routes.dart` file:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:package_name/presentation/home_screen/home_screen.dart';

class AppRoutes {
  static const String initial = '/';
  static const String home = '/home';

  static Map<String, WidgetBuilder> routes = {
    initial: (context) => const SplashScreen(),
    home: (context) => const HomeScreen(),
    // Add more routes as needed
  }
}
```

## Theming

This project includes a comprehensive theming system with both light and dark themes:

```dart
// Access the current theme
ThemeData theme = Theme.of(context);

// Use theme colors
Color primaryColor = theme.colorScheme.primary;
```

The theme configuration includes:
- Color schemes for light and dark modes
- Typography styles
- Button themes
- Input decoration themes
- Card and dialog themes

## Responsive Design

The app is built with responsive design using the Sizer package:

```dart
// Example of responsive sizing
Container(
  width: 50.w, // 50% of screen width
  height: 20.h, // 20% of screen height
  child: Text('Responsive Container'),
)
```
## Deployment

Build the application for production:

```bash
# For Android
flutter build apk --release

# For iOS
flutter build ios --release
```
